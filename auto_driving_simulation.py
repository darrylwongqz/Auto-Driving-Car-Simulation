"""
Auto Driving Car Simulation
-----------------------------

This program simulates one or more autonomous cars on a rectangular field.
Cars can be added with a unique name, starting position, direction, and a command string.
The commands are:
    - L: rotate 90째 left
    - R: rotate 90째 right
    - F: move forward 1 grid point
If a car would leave the field, the F command is ignored.

When multiple cars are simulated, commands are executed concurrently (one command
per car per step). If two or more cars ever occupy the same grid cell during a step,
they are considered collided and will no longer process further commands.
